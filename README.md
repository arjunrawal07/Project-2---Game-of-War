# Game-of-War

## Description:
This application is a console based Game of War where the results are diplayed in the console.

The game begins with the computer creating the deck, shuffling, and dealing the deck into two stacks - one for each player.

Each user flips their top card. Whoever flipped the greater card adds the played cards to the bottom of their stack. If each user played the same card (same rank and value), then the users go to war.

During war, each player places the top three cards from their respective decks in the pile. Then each user flips over the the next top card. Whoever wins the war takes all the cards from the pile and places them at the bottom of their deck.

## Technologies Used:
* Vanilla Javascript

## Challeneges:
The main challenge was in the logic. This was my first major project utilizing Javascript, so breaking down each key step of the game into small, manageable pieces or functions was critical.

I also learned the value of the console.  Through this project, I became comfortable with using the console to test logic and debug. This was an invaluable lesson as I utilized the console in every subsequent assignment and project.
